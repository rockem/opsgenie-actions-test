[![Test OpsGenie Actions](https://github.com/rockem/opsgenie-actions-test/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rockem/opsgenie-actions-test/actions/workflows/test.yml)

This repository acts as a utility for all my OpsGenie GitHub actions

It includes 2 workflows:
1. Sanity test for all actions 
2. Purging old test alerts from OpsGenie (as we don't have this ability on the free tier of OpsGenie)
